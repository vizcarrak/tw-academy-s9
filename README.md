## Bold

Use bold to highlight button names, fields names, menus, radio buttons, or checkboxes. For
example:

- Click the **Create** button to start the process.
- Enter your IP address in the **IP Address** field.

## Italics

Use italics to emphasize a word or group of words. For example:
- *At least* two reviews are required before you check in your code.
- You must *not* enter without your ID card.

IMPORTANT: Use this style sparingly to avoid diluting its strength.

## Fixed Font

Use a fixed font to highlight:
- **Commands or pieces of code**. For example:
Run the npm install text-cli command to install the utility.
- **File or folder names**. For example:
Read the README.md file before you proceed.

## Abbreviations
Never use the following abbreviations in a formal document:

|  | |  |
| ---    | ---    | ---     |
| e.g. | Instead use “for example”.| 
| i.e. | Instead use “in other words”. | 
| etc. | Instead give the full list of options.| 
| fig. | Instead spell it out as “figure”. | 
| pg. | Instead spell it out as “page”. | 

## Capitalization

- Use standard capitalization rules. Also, keep in mind the following:
The first word after a colon (:) is always capitalized.
- Every heading, table caption, figure caption, column name, or a callout in a figure or table
must be in the title case.

## Acronyms
Always define an acronym when you are using it for the first time.
For example: This section specifies the terms used in a Product Requirement Document (PRD).
The most often used terms in a PRD include…

## Commas in Lists
The rules regarding commas for in-sentence lists are as follows:
- Do not use a comma before “and” and “or” if your list contains *only two items*. For example:
Any new organization needs to invest in good infrastructure and hiring great talent.
- Use a comma before “and” and “or” when your list comprises *three or more items*. For
example: A “Pod” comprises a Project Manager, a Technical Writer, Engineers, and UX
designers.

## Numbers
Remember these rules about numbers:
 - Spell out numbers that are less than 10 (0 - 9). For example: I have seven aunts.
- Use numerals for 10 and higher.
For example: This hub has 32 ports.
- Use a comma to make it easier to read numbers higher than 999.
For example: The network supports up to 10,000 connections.

## Contractions
Contractions are considered informal writing. To prevent “stuffiness” use the contraction
“don’t”. Avoid other contractions such as “it’s” or “doesn’t”.

## Apostrophes
Do not use an apostrophe for the plural of acronyms. For example:

|  | |  |
| ---    | ---    | ---     
| API’s | Instead use APIs
| LAN’s | Instead use LANs
